Bluesky Media Downloader v1.0.5 - Mercury Variant

My personal version of the project hosted at https://github.com/awkwardusername/bluesky-media-downloader, with a few changes and improvements.

- Updated the value of "actionBarSelector" to match a corresponding change to BlueSky.
- Video downloads now fetch a list of all versions hosted on bluesky and download the one with the highest resolution, instead of defaulting to 360p
- Downloads no longer have the download date as part of their filename, making it easier to manage your archives.
- Images save to a subfolder called "bluesky_downloads". This prevents all of your downloads from cluttering up your computer's Downloads folder. I couldn't get videos to download to a subfolder, so you'll just have to do without.

This is really just my personal modifications to the extension, and I wanted to share them because I figured others would potentially find this useful.
