Bluesky Media Downloader v1.0.2

Unpacked extension from https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bluesky-media-downloader/odebdafkpnmipmdangfpfbhdamhdocdb 

This extension does not have the AI bullshit and works seamlessly, unlike version 1.0.3 - additionaly, of which pops up a save dialog everytime you try to download media from Bluesky.
